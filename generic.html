							<h1 class="major">About me</h1>
							<p>I attend to Corvinus University of Budapest, Faculty of Business Informatic. This is my third year in this institution.<br/>During my studies I have gained a lot of new knowledge in connection to Information Technology, including web developing, software developing skills, and proficiency related to data science</p>
							<p>Beside the university it was always important for me to broad my horizont in the field of IT also in my free time. I wrote my first codes at the age of eighteen, and I have get acquented with the basics of object oriented programming.<br>
							At the university I was able to deepen this knowledge by learning software development for one and a half year.</p><p>
							During my academic years the web developing became the most interesting and usefull field of Informatic for me. I have learnt HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, and MySQL for two years autodidact, and I've created several hobby projects.<br/>
							With the help of Appworld's course I have got familiar with different types of frontend, and backend frameworks, take for instance Bootstrap, JQuery, React, and Laravel. It has offered also a great opportunity, to deepen and complete my previous experiences related to the native technologies.
							</p>
							<p>
							In the future I would like to gain practical experiences in the field of full stack web developing.
