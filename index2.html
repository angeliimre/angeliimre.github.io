									<h2>About me</h2>
									<p>My name is Imre Angeli, 23 years old, and I graduated in January 2024 from the Budapest Corvinus University with a degree in Business Informatics, achieving an excellent rating. I completed my high school studies at Tóparti Gimnázium in Székesfehérvár, specializing in the German section.</p>
									<p>Before graduation I became interested in programming, and I sought to explore its possibilities. Since C# seemed to be the most suitable programming language for the exams, and my teacher recommended it, I initially learned this language. Additionally, I had the opportunity to learn C# at Corvinus University.</p>
								  <p>During my academic years, alongside software development, I gained comprehensive knowledge in the field of data analysis. From the second year onwards, I mainly focused on data science, leveraging my years of programming experience. Throughout my studies, I acquired extensive mathematical, statistical, and econometric knowledge. Furthermore, I took on demonstrator roles for two years in Mathematics 1 (analysis) and Statistics 1 courses.</p>
                  <p>I gained extensive practical knowledge in the Python programming language. In this environment, I completed numerous data analysis projects, primarily for executing ETL processes, using various packages such as Pandas, NumPy, Beautiful Soup, and Selenium. Additionally, I wrote programs for natural language processing and machine learning procedures. Besides Python, I also developed a broad understanding of the R programming language, using it for projects related to exploring relationships between variables, model building, and creating data visualizations. I utilized both of these programming languages in my thesis.</p>
                  <p>In the field of database management, I primarily dealt with querying and manipulating relational data files using the SQL language. However, I also familiarized myself with other NoSQL technologies such as MongoDB, Neo4j, Cassandra, and Redis.</p>
                  <p>During my university years, I learned various business intelligence solutions. Beyond Excel skills, I gained practical knowledge in Tableau and RapidMiner for project development. Through courses organized by the BIT student organization, I also explored the capabilities of Power BI.</p>
                  <p>On February 26, 2023, I participated in an innovation competition organized by K&H Bank with 4 teammates, and we secured the first place. Afterwards I successfully applied for a software development internship position announced by the bank, and I have been working in this role since May 8, 2023, alongside my university studies. In my work, I primarily engage in Java development, gaining experience in both frontend (Wicket) and backend technologies (Spring Boot).</p>
                  <p>In May 2023, my fellow students and I achieved first place in the university data visualization competition organized by Bixpert Kft. We created the project using the MicroStrategy software.</p>
